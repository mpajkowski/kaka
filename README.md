# kaka
(An attempt to write) a modal text editor.

# Project assumptions

- keymap and modes akin to `vim`
- interaction via special buffers (e.g. tree explorers, terminals, etc.) is done with keymaps specific to them.
  Motivation: to not pollute the normal mode keymap.
- LSP integration
- Tree-sitter integration
